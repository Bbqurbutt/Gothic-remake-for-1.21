# Gothic-remake-for-1.21
Howester84 gothic castle ported to 1.21.
I DID NOT MAKE THE BUILD, I JUST PORTED IT TO 1.21 WITH VANILLA BLOCKS

dimension:
121x185x110

 All i did was remove all modded blocks and ported it to 1.21 for building gadgets (BG) 2. 

 You can easily change out what blocks are used where in BG2, so I suggest doing that, since a half million coal is a tall order.

 Steps taken:
 * Create 1.12 world with mods needed for initial build
 * Paste each individual part out and exhange modded blocks for vanilla ones
 *   * I tried replacing text through the BG1 JSON file, which did not seem to work, so I used exchange tool to manually swap out blocks
 * Move world to 1.21 mc version
 * Further divide each parts to fit within BG2 volume limits

Notes:
* There are some artifacts from me not finding all blocks, some walls will be hollow instead of filled in, I couldn't be bothered to destroy each wall to check if it needed to be replaced where you cannot and will not see it.
* I also had to double up on walls, since there was only cobble and mossy walls in 1.12 vanilla. I tried to go back and swap some back to blackstone, but i gave up on that.
* I also probably missed some stairs or something, its a big build and I just wanted to actually start using it.
